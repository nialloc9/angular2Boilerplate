    <!--1. LOAD LIBRARIES -->
    <script src="node_modules/core-js/client/shim.min.js"></script> <!--  monkey patches the global context (window) with essential features of ES2015 (ES6). -->

    <!--  Next are the polyfills for Angular2, zone.js and reflect-metadata. -->
    <script src="node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js"></script>

    <!-- 2. Configure SystemJS -->
    <script src="systemjs.config.js"></script> <!-- There are alternatives like webpack but we choosse SystemJs. -->
    <!--
     All module loaders require configuration and all loader configuration becomes complicated rather quickly as soon as the file structure diversifies
     and we start thinking about building for production and performance.
     -->
    <!-- SystemJS
    With those cautions in mind, what are we doing in the QuickStart systemjs.config.js configuration file we added earlier? First, we create a map to tell
     SystemJS where to look when we import some module. Then, we register all our packages to SystemJS: all the project dependencies and our application package, app.
     Our QuickStart doesn't use all of the listed packages but any substantial application will want many of them and all of the listed packages are required by at
     least one of the documentation samples.

    There is no runtime harm in listing packages that we don't need as they will only be loaded when requested.#

    In SystemJs The app package tells SystemJS what to do when it sees a request for a module from the app/ folder.
    Notice that the module name (after from) does not mention a filename extension. In the configuration we tell
    SystemJS to default the extension to js, a JavaScript file.

    <script>
        System.import('app').catch(function(err){console.error(err); }); //Import app module which refers to the main file. Catch exception.
    </script>

<!-- 3. Display the application -->
<body>
<my-app>Loading...</my-app> <!-- Remember app.components selects the element named my-app. This is  is where our app lives -->
<!--
 When Angular calls the bootstrap function in main.ts, it reads the AppComponent metadata, finds the my-app selector, locates an element
 tag named my-app, and renders our application's view between those tags.
 -->
</body>
